# Contributing

First, please do contribute! There are three ways to contribute:

1. introduce june to your friends
2. discuss june, and submit bugs with github issues
3. send patch with github pull request


## Codebase

You should follow the code style

A little hint to make things simple:

- when you cloned this repo, run `make`, it will prepare everything for you
- check the code style with `make lint`
- check the test case with `make testing`


## Git Help

Something you should know about git.

- don't add any code on the master branch, create a new one
- don't add too many code in on pull request

Hint of git:

```
$ git branch [feature-name]
$ git checkout [feature-name]
```

## Checklist

We are still on development, and this is a total rewrite of june in flask.
